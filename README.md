# Code_Quiz
This is a timed quiz, with five questions about coding. When you get an answer wrong, 10 seconds is deducted from your time left. When you click on an answer it takes you to the next question. When you answer the fifth and final question, a form appears to enter your initials to store your score. Your score is your time left after the final question is answered. Your intitals and score are stored locally in an array. Everytime you retake the quiz, a new array is added to the array object with your new score and initials.
